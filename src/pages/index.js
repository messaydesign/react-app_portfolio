  It is all about solving problems, if not it would be pixel art. Product design always starts with understanding the problem rigorously.The fun part being a product designer is that I have problems to solve every single day with collaborative problem-solving process. In my 7+ years journey I realize that close collaboration of multidisciplinary team with a design process creates a winning product. 
Each individual from different disciplinary provides a unique and valuable perspective about the problem, as product enhances and feature updates have a huge impact across internal and external products.   In my product design process, I‚Äôll be focusing on four areas I believe will facilitate my ability to make meaningful contributions to the team I am working with.
